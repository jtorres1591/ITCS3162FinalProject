**Introduction**

For this project we would be trying to divide a list of Pokemon into tiers based on how high their base stats are. Across the Generations, there have usually been cases of more Pokemon being introduced with higher base stat totals, we wanted to see if this was true, or if it was true for any other category. We will be using clustering, seperating them by base stats. They will then be grouped up by generations. The main question for this project is “Which Generation has the highest average base stat total?”  

**About the Data**

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and is titled “Pokemon Stats” by Ulrik Thyge Pedersen. This dataset is 60KB, has 13 columns and 1072 entries. The usability of the data is at 10. This dataset accounts for all Pokemon up to Pokemon Sword and Shield’s Expansion Pass (The other entries are for all alternate forms, such as regional variants, Megas, Gigantamax, gender, and other alternate forms). The 13 features include the Pokedex number, Name, two Types, six Base Stats, Base Stat total, Generation, and whether the Pokemon is a Legendary.

**Storytelling and Conclusion**
  Pokemon is a very popular game and its name is recognized by almost everyone. Pokemon Stats are of great interest to many fans of this game. The strength of the species is known as base stats and these base stats are important  in determining the power and potential the species has in a battle. A species’s base stats ranges from 1 to 255. A lot of people claim that a common pattern in Pokemon is species which have a higher evolutionary stage will have higher base stats. We know that there are exceptions like Scizor and Klevor but we want to see if the pattern of species belonging to a higher evolutionary stage have higher base stats. We are using clustering models to analyze the base stats because we feel this information can be useful to players of Pokemon, especially new players of Pokemon. In order to play the game well, a player needs to know how the base stats values of each species are assigned.
One thing that we noted while looking at the base stats of Pokemon is that species from different branches with a split evolutionary line often times have similar base stats. Another interesting thing that we noted is that Pokemon with very high base stats are often times  banned from battle facilities. 

**Impact Section**

A positive impact from this project is that it can be used to understand the different pokemon from each generations. Maybe it can help beginners or even veteran players see that each generation pokemons were not made equally as the total base stats are different from each other. A negative impact from this is that pokemon is just a game and you can really just make your team the way you want. It doesn't really matter if one generation is stronger then the next or vice versa. Another positive impact
